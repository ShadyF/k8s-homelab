# Installing k3s

[k3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/) is a lightweight version of Kubernetes, meant to be used on edge devices,
in CI, ARM boards and so on.

It's basically a single binary that contains everything to get kubernetes up and running.

To help us with installing `k3s`, we're going to be using a utility package
called [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup)
